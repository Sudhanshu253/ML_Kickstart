# ML Kickstart
## Projects Overview

### 1. Feed-Forward Neural Network for MNIST
- Built a fully vectorized feed-forward neural network from scratch using **NumPy**.
- Trained on the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset**, achieving **92% accuracy**.
- Implemented backpropagation, weight initialization, and mini-batch gradient descent.

### 2. MLP Model for Spotify Genre Classification
- Tuned a **3-layer MLP model in TensorFlow** for classifying Spotify audio tracks by genre.
- Improved validation accuracy from **78% to 83%** through hyperparameter tuning and batch normalization.

### 3. Learning-Curve Diagnostics
- Applied **learning-curve analysis in TensorFlow** to detect overfitting and underfitting.
- Optimized training to **reduce validation loss by 28%**, ensuring better generalization.
